This is an implementation of the Ear-Clipping Method for Polygon Triangulation. The worst case run time is O(n^2).

Explanation:
An ear of a polygon is a triangle formed by three consecutive vertices Vi0,Vi1, and Vi2 for which Vi1 is a convex vertex 
(the interior angle at the vertex is smaller than π radians or 180 degrees), 
the line segment from Vi0 to Vi2 lies completely inside the polygon, and no vertices of the polygon are contained in the triangle 
other thanthe three vertices of the triangle. 
The  first  step  is  to store the polygon as a doubly linked list so that you can quickly remove ear tips.  Construction of this list is an O(n) process. 
The second step is to iterate over the vertices and find the ears. For each vertex V_i
and corresponding triangle h V_i−1 , V_i , V_i+1 i (indexing is modulo n, so V_n = V_0 and V_−1 = V_n−1 ), test
all other vertices to see if any are inside the triangle. If none are inside, you have an ear. If at least one
is inside, you do not have an ear. The actual implementation I provide tries to make this somewhat more
efficient. It is sufficient to consider only reflex vertices in the triangle containment test. A reflex vertex is one
for which the interior angle formed by the two edges sharing it is larger than 180 degrees. A convex vertex
is one for which the interior angle is smaller than 180 degrees. The data structure for the polygon maintains
four doubly linked lists simultaneously, using an array for storage rather than dynamically allocating and
deallocating memory in a standard list data structure. The vertices of the polygon are stored in a cyclical
list, the convex vertices are stored in a linear list, the reflex vertices are stored in a linear list, and the ear
tips are stored in a cyclical list.
Once the initial lists for reflex vertices and ears are constructed, the ears are removed one at a time. If V_i is
an ear that is removed, then the edge configuration at the adjacent vertices V_i−1 and V_i+1 can change. If
an adjacent vertex is convex, a quick sketch will convince you that it remains convex. If an adjacent vertex
is an ear, it does not necessarily remain an ear after V_i is removed. If the adjacent vertex is reflex, it is
possible that it becomes convex and, possibly, an ear. Thus, after the removal of V_i , if an adjacent vertex
is convex you must test if it is an ear by iterating over over the reflex vertices and testing for containment
in the triangle of that vertex. There are O(n) ears. Each update of an adjacent vertex involves an earness
test, a process that is O(n) per update. Thus, the total removal process is O(n^2).
