Implementation of an automatic Tic Tac Toe player that can never lose. Matches can be drawn but computer never loses.

I have mapped the moves that the computer will make into numbers that can be stored in arrays. Now, in order to apply those moves, I have created some helper functions,
which will follow that particular set of moves.
