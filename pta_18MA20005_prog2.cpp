This is an implementation of the Plane-Sweep Monotone Transformation for Polygon Triangulation. The worst case run time is O(n logn ). 
The entire implementation is not complete yet. It identitfies the split and merge vertices now and tries to convert into monotone polygons

Our approach is based on a two-step process (although
with a little cleverness, both steps could be combined into one algorithm).
 First, the simple polygon is decomposed into a collection of simpler polygons, called
monotone polygons. This step takes O(n log n) time.  - this is almost complete for our case
 Second, each of the monotone polygons is triangulated separately, and the result are
combined. This step takes O(n) time. - this step has not been implemented yet
A polygonal curve C is monotone with respect to ` if each line that is orthogonal to ` intersects
C in a single connected component. (It may intersect, not at all, at a single point, or along
a single line segment.) A polygonal curve C is said to be strictly monotone with respect to
a given line `, if any line that is orthogonal to ` intersects C in at most one point.
We begin with the assumption that the vertices of the polygon have been sorted in increasing , which will be done by us later one=
order of their y-coordinates. (For simplicity we assume no duplicate x-coordinates. Otherwise,
break ties between the upper and lower chains arbitrarily, and within a chain break ties so
that the chain order is preserved.) We can simply extract the upper and lower chain, and merge them (as done in MergeSort) in O(n)
In order to run the above triangulation algorithm, we rst need to
subdivide an arbitrary simple polygon P into monotone polygons. This is also done by a plane-sweep approach.
Based on certain properties, we subdivide the vertices into 4 classes if they are special :
â€¢ Start Vertex - its two neighbors lie below it
and the interior angle < 180Â°
â€¢ End Vertex - its two neighbors lie above it and
the interior angle < 180Â°
â€¢ Split Vertex - its two neighbors lie below it and
the interior angle > 180Â°
â€¢ Merge Vertex - its two neighbors lie above it
and the interior angle > 180Â°
we need to maintain a vertex that is visible to any split
vertex that may arise between ea and eb. To do this, imagine a sweeping a vertical segment
between ea and eb to the left until it hits a vertex. Called this helper(ea) - Another way to visualize the helper is to imagine sweeping out a trapezoid to the left from
the sweep line. The top side of the trapezoid lies on ea, the bottom side lies on eb, the right
side lies on the sweep line, and the left side is sweeps as far as it can until hitting a vertex
helper(ea) is dened with respect to the current location of the sweep line. As
the sweep line moves, its value changes. The helper is dened only for those edges intersected
by the sweep line. Our approach will be to join each split vertex to helper(ea), where ea is
the edge of P immediately above the split vertex. (
whenever we see a split vertex, we add a diagonal to the helper of
the edge immediately above it. We defer adding diagonals to merge vertices until the
next opportunity arises.
Similarly, we can do the same for merge vertices i.e, attach them to the nearest helper function. 
In this way, our monotone polygon will be generated
Now, we have to triangulize a particular monotone polygon. This can be done in O(n) time using our 
hypothesis. 
We dene a reflex vertex to be a vertex of the polygon whose interior angle is at least pi, and
otherwise the vertex is nonreflex. We dene a reflex chain to be a sequence of one or more
consecutive reflex vertices along the polygon's boundary.
The idea behind the triangulation algorithm is quite simple: Try to triangulate everything you
can to the left of the current vertex by adding diagonals, and then remove the triangulated
region from further consideration. The trickiest aspect of implementing this idea is nding a
clean invariant that characterizes the untriangulated region that lies to the left of the sweep
line. Ideally, this structure will be simple enough to allow us to determine in
constant time whether it is possible to add another diagonal. And in general we can add each
additional diagonal in constant time. Since any triangulation consists of nô€€€3 diagonals, the
process runs in O(n) total time.
